# KingOil

## Description

This project seeks to implement the Milton Bradley board game from the 1970s called King Oil. The Wikipedia page has since been taken down. An archive of the wikipedia page can be found in [Wikipedia Archive](WIKI.md). 

The game requires players to [[Oil well|drill for oil]] on a three-dimensional board, acquiring property and wealth until one player owns all properties or the bank runs out of money.
